<p>Hi, I'm Zain (Patel)! I've recently graduated from the University of Cambridge with a mathematics degree and started at <a href="https://www.quantumblack.com">QuantumBlack / McKinsey </a> on the <a href="https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/studio">Studio</a> team in the new QuantumBlack Labs division. It's been great fun so far!</p>

<p>I've previously interned at Satavia, a small startup in Cambridge aimed at providing digital intelligence to the aviation industry, where I worked on desinging and building their Flights API, which would return the impact on a given flights engine based on the environmental factors the plane encountered on the flight path.</p>

<p>Please feel free to reach out to me for a chat!</p>
