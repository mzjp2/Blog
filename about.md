<p>Hi, I'm Zain (Patel)! I'm currently a third year mathematics undergraduate at the University of Cambridge. I'll soon be starting at <a href="https://www.quantumblack.com">McKinsey QuantumBlack</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro">Kedro</a> team in the new QuantumBlack Labs division. I'm looking forward to starting!</p>

<p>I've previously interned at Satavia, a small startup in Cambridge aimed at providing digital intelligence to the aviation industry, where I worked on desinging and building their Flights API, which would return the impact on a given flights engine based on the environmental factors the plane encountered on the flight path.</p>

<p>Please feel free to reach out to me for a chat.</p>
