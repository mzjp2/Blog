Hi, I'm Zain (Patel)! I've recently graduated from the University of Cambridge with a mathematics degree and started at [QuantumBlack / McKinsey](https://quantumblack.com) on the Studio team in the new [QuantumBlack Labs](https://quantumblack.com/labs) division. It's been great fun so far!

I've since worked across some of the different product teams, including the open source [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro) project, which is a development workflow framework with significant contributions to [CausalNex](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/causalnex) which is a toolkit for causal reasoning and 'what-if" analysis using Bayesian networks. I've also worked on one client project, helping a Formula E team win their races using advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques.

I'm an avid open source contributor, contributing to several projects from being a core develop on [Zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python) to major contributions on [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations) and contributions to the wider data science tooling ecosystem including Pytorch and various other projects like the popular Go Slack SDK.

I've previously interned at Satavia, a small startup in Cambridge aimed at providing digital intelligence to the aviation industry, where I worked on designing and building their Flights API, which would return the impact on a given flights engine based on the environmental factors the plane encountered on the flight path.

Please feel free to reach out to me for a chat!
